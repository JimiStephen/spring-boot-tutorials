Application events are sent in the following order, as your application runs:
1. An ApplicationStartingEvent is sent at the start of a run but before any processing, except
for the registration of listeners and initializers.
2. An ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent is sent when the Environment to be used in the
context is known but before the context is created.
3. An ApplicationPreparedEvent is sent just before the refresh is started but after bean definitions
have been loaded.
4. An ApplicationStartedEvent is sent after the context has been refreshed but before any
application and command-line runners have been called.
5. An ApplicationReadyEvent is sent after any application and command-line runners have been
called. It indicates that the application is ready to service requests.
6. An ApplicationFailedEvent is sent if there is an exception on startup.
Tip
You often need not use application events, but it can be handy to know that they exist. Internally,
Spring Boot uses events to handle a variety of tasks.
Application events are sent by using Spring Frameworkâ€™s event publishing mechanism. Part of this
mechanism ensures that an event published to the listeners in a child context is also published
to the listeners in any ancestor contexts. As a result of this, if your application uses a hierarchy
of SpringApplication instances, a listener may receive multiple instances of the same type of
application event.Spring Boot Reference Guide

To allow your listener to distinguish between an event for its context and an event for a
descendant context, it should request that its application context is injected and then compare
the injected context with the context of the event. The context can be injected by implementing
ApplicationContextAware or, if the listener is a bean, by using @Autowired
